The Movie Management System is tasked with processing and organizing a vast collection of movie records initially stored in text files by year. Each record details multiple attributes of a movie, such as year, title, duration, genres, and more. The project involves partitioning these records by genre, serializing them for efficient storage, and deserializing them into a navigable format for user interaction.

<b>Technical Specifications:</b>

 - Data Handling: Movies are classified and stored in genre-specific files, with each record serialized into a binary format to optimize storage and retrieval.
 - Error Handling: The system robustly handles both syntax and semantic errors in movie data, logging issues and ensuring data integrity.
 - Interactive Navigation: Users can navigate through serialized movie records interactively, providing a user-friendly way to access movie details based on genre.
